# 👋 Hi, I'm Petiton Wiseley Paul-Enzer

I'm a passionate **Software Developer** and **Computer Science student** at Université Laval who builds robust, scalable applications across web and desktop platforms. 
I love solving real-world problems through clean code and innovative solutions.

## 🚀 What I Do

- **Full-Stack Web Development** – Building responsive, feature-rich web applications with Django, Vue.js, Node.js, and modern JavaScript frameworks
- **Desktop Applications** – Creating intuitive desktop software with Java Swing, Qt, and C++ for complex problem-solving
- **Backend Architecture** – Designing RESTful APIs, real-time communication with WebSockets, and database optimization with PostgreSQL and MongoDB
- **DevOps & CI/CD** – Implementing automated testing, clean code practices, and continuous integration pipelines
- **IoT & Embedded Systems** – Developing connected smart systems with real-time web dashboards for monitoring and control
- **Network Programming** – Building network protocols and client-server applications with Python socket programming (SMTP server implementation)
