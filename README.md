# Petiton Wiseley Paul-Enzer

Software Engineering Student @ Université Laval | Building scalable systems and learning to write maintainable code

I build full-stack applications and care deeply about software architecture. Right now, I'm learning how clean code, solid design patterns, and proper testing make the difference between code that works and code that lasts. Looking for an internship where I can contribute to real projects and keep growing as a developer.

## What I Do

I solve problems by writing code that's meant to be read, maintained, and scaled. Whether it's a Django web app with real-time features, a desktop application in Java, or a backend API following **SOLID principles**, I focus on building things the right way.

**Areas I work in:**
- Full-stack web development with strong backend architecture
- RESTful API design and real-time communication (WebSockets)
- Desktop applications with native interfaces
- DevOps fundamentals (Docker, CI/CD, automated testing)
- Object-oriented design with proven patterns

**Tech Stack:**  
Python • Java • C++ • JavaScript • TypeScript • Rust • Django • Vue.js • Next.js • Node.js • Express • PostgreSQL • MongoDB • Docker • Redis • Celery • Git

## Projects That Matter

### Toastmasters-App (Personal Project)
**Django • PostgreSQL • Celery • Redis • JavaScript • HTML • CSS • Bootstrap • Docker**

A complete club management platform handling meeting scheduling, role assignments, speech evaluations, and progress tracking. I implemented **asynchronous task processing** with Celery for email automation, built analytics dashboards with Chart.js, and created a **PDF generation system** for certificates and meeting agendas using ReportLab. 

The architecture follows Django's **MVT pattern**, uses PostgreSQL for relational data with optimized queries, and Redis for task queue management. Deployed on Railway with Docker containerization for consistent environments across development and production.

**Key learnings:** Database schema design, async task handling, template rendering optimization, and production deployment workflows.

### HeatMyFloor
**Java • Swing • Algorithm Design • Object-Oriented Design**

A heated floor design application that automatically generates wire paths using **constraint-based algorithms**. The system handles irregular room shapes, furniture placement with obstacle avoidance, and real-time visual rendering.

Built applying **OOP principles** including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Implemented **design patterns** (Observer for UI updates, Strategy for path generation algorithms) and followed **Larman's Controller pattern** for separating domain logic from presentation.

**Key learnings:** Applying **SOLID+T principles**, constraint satisfaction problems, algorithmic optimization, and building maintainable class hierarchies.

### Banking Software
**C++ • Qt • Object-Oriented Design**

A minimalist banking system demonstrating core **C++ concepts**: encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, and proper memory management. Features include deposit/withdrawal operations, automatic interest calculation, and bank statement generation.

Built with Qt for the GUI layer and comprehensive unit testing with Google Test. The architecture separates business logic from presentation, making the codebase testable and extensible.

**Key learnings:** C++ memory management, polymorphic class design, Qt event-driven programming, and unit testing strategies.

### UFood (In Development)
**Vue.js • Node.js • Express • MongoDB • Socket.io • Passport.js**

A social restaurant discovery platform where users find restaurants, share favorites, and interact in real-time. I'm implementing the **MVC architecture** on the backend with Express, using **Mongoose ODM** for MongoDB schema validation, and **Passport.js** for authentication strategies.

The frontend uses **Vue.js** with component-based architecture and **ES6+** features (async/await, destructuring, arrow functions). Real-time updates are handled via **Socket.io** for bidirectional event-based communication.

**Key learnings:** NoSQL data modeling, WebSocket protocols, JWT authentication, RESTful API design, and frontend state management.

---

### Java Backend API (In Development)
**Java • Spring Boot • CI/CD • TDD • Clean Code**

A backend-focused project for my Software Engineering Processes course (GLO-2003) where I'm applying modern development practices: **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, **continuous integration/deployment**, automated build pipelines, and **clean code principles**.

The course covers **DevOps workflows**, dependency management, version control strategies, code quality metrics, and refactoring techniques. This is where I'm learning to write code that teams can actually work with.

**Key learnings:** TDD methodology, CI/CD pipeline setup, clean architecture, SOLID in practice, and collaborative development workflows.

---

### Smart City Robot Navigation System (In Planning)
**IoT • Real-Time Systems • Path Planning Algorithms**

An autonomous robot system for merchandise transportation with a web dashboard for route initialization, real-time position tracking, obstacle detection, and dynamic path planning. This is my design project where I'll integrate embedded systems with web technologies.

**Planned stack:** Embedded C/C++ for robot control, WebSocket server for real-time communication, path-finding algorithms (A*, Dijkstra), and a responsive web interface for monitoring.

---

### Internal SMTP Email Server
**Python • Socket Programming • Network Protocols**

A custom email server for internal communication built from scratch using Python's socket library. Implements the **SMTP protocol**, handles multi-client connections with threading, and manages email routing with domain-based addressing.

This project forced me to understand how network protocols actually work under the hood—parsing commands, managing TCP connections, handling errors gracefully, and implementing a state machine for SMTP transactions.

**Key learnings:** Network programming fundamentals, protocol implementation, concurrent connection handling, and low-level socket operations.

## What I'm Looking For

I want an internship where I can:
- Work on real projects that ship to production
- Learn from experienced developers who care about code quality
- Apply what I'm learning about clean architecture and testing
- Contribute meaningfully to a team's codebase

I learn fast, ask good questions, and don't give up until things work properly. If you need someone motivated who cares about writing maintainable code, let's talk.
